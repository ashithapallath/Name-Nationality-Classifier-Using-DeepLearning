# Nationality Classifier


This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based nationality classifier designed to determine whether a name belongs to an Indian or Non-Indian individual. By analyzing name patterns using advanced neural networks, this project aims to provide accurate predictions of nationality, which can be applied in various domains such as demographic analysis, personalized services, and more.

This project was developed as part of an academic experiment to explore the capabilities of deep learning models in linguistic and cultural classification.



## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Build a Classifier**:
   - Design a deep learning model capable of distinguishing Indian from Non-Indian names based on training data.

2. **Explore Name Patterns**:
   - Leverage neural network architectures to analyze phonetic, linguistic, and cultural patterns in names.

3. **Test and Evaluate**:
   - Validate the modelâ€™s performance on diverse datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.


## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements a neural network optimized for text-based classification.
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Extracts features from names to identify patterns.
- **Versatile Applications**: Useful for demographic studies, marketing, and automated services.



## Methodology

1. **Dataset**:
   - The model is trained using datasets from the following sources:
     - [Indian Female Names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashavish/name-nationality/master/data/datasets_70812_149772_Indian-Female-Names.csv)
     - [Indian Male Names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashavish/name-nationality/master/data/datasets_70812_149772_Indian-Male-Names.csv)

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - A neural network with embedding layers for feature extraction.
   - ReLU activation for non-linearity.
   - BatchNormalization and Dropout layers for improved stability and generalization.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the model with a labeled dataset.
   - Use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
   - Optimize using Adam optimizer.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Test the classifier on unseen names.
   - Report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
